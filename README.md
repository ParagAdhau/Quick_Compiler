Our language : Quick can be said to a subset of C.
It supports :  
1.Including Macros and header files
2.Various function definations (every function should have a return type also function can return another function )
3.Global declarations of variables (all integeres intialised to 0 )
4.Nested looping (we have implemented the same for loop as C )
5.Conditinal statements (if and if-else statements)
6.Passsing variables by values and reference
7.There are 2 supported data types = string ( char ) and integeres ( int )
8.Input-Output statements : quickin>>variable and quickout<<variable_or_complex_epression
9.Arrays are also supported (Only One-dimensional arrays are supported)
